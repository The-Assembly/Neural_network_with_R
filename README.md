# Neural Network using R

![Workshop Title](https://github.com/The-Assembly/Neural_network_with_R/blob/master/NeuralNetwork_with_R.jpg)

In this workshop, we’ll apply this to the field of machine learning and show you how you can use R to create and visualize a neural network that takes in a dataset and trains a model to predict outcomes.
